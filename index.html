                The Frame is a popular attraction in Dubai, located in the
                Zabeel Park area. It's a unique structure that's shaped like a
                giant picture frame, with two 150-meter-high towers connected by
                a 93-meter-long bridge at the top. Visitors can take an elevator
                to the top of the structure, where they can enjoy panoramic
                views of the city. Inside The Frame, there is also a museum that
                showcases the history of Dubai, as well as interactive exhibits
                and displays that allow visitors to learn more about the city's
                past, present, and future. There is also a glass walkway on the
                top floor of the structure, which allows visitors to look down
                at the city from above.
